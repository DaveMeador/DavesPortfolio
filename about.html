									<h2>Dave's Bio</h2>
								
									<p>
										David Meador, began his coding career in 1970 after being discharged from the U.S. Marine Corps. Dave took a job with a Kansas City insurance
										 company as their Tab Operator.  
										The company had plans to purchase a computer to replace their tabulating equipment. </p>

										<p>Dave attended numerous programming classes learning RPG, which was a popular programming language along with COBAL at the time. 
										</p>
										Dave wrote all the programs and procedures for that small company and maintained their computing needs until the company was sold.
										<p>
										Dave continued his programming career as a programmer, project manager, IT manager until he took a job as a computer consultant with a contract programming company.
										The contract programming company (Data Systems International) eventually developed a programming language for data collection (TranBuilder).  Also developed were interfaces 
										to several popular Enterprise Software systems like Oracle, SAP, JD Edwards.  The language became very popular with small to mid-sized companies that needed data collection 
										used for inventory control, asset management and many others reasons.
										</p>
										In 2001 Dave took the position of Consultant with DSI and began coding using DSIâ€™s unique language.  Occasionally he would use his RPG skills (JD Edwards World software product was coded in RPG).  
										During the next 19 years he worked with companies all over the US and the world, traveling to cities in Canada, Mexico, Europe and even a single trip to China.
										<p>
										Dave retired in March, 2020 after 50 years of coding / programming / <u>problem-solving</u>. </p>
										<p>
										Finding retirement boring Dave has decided to learn web coding.
